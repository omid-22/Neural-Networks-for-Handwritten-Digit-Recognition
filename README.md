# Neural-Networks-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

2.1 Problem Statement
In this exercise, you will use a neural network to recognize two handwritten digits, zero and one. This is a binary classification task. Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. You will extend this network to recognize all 10 digits (0-9) in a future assignment.

This exercise will show you how the methods you have learned can be used for this classification task.
